                        1.1 Only titles that are Japanese, Korean, Chinese or other Asian origin are allowed. Exceptions
                        can be made, but contact staff beforehand. <br>
                        1.2 Oneshots that were published in an anthology should be included in the respective anthology
                        entry and should not have their own entries. <br>
                        1.3 A single-chapter oneshot that has been serialized should have its own entry which is linked
                        via the “Serialization” relation to the serialized entry. <br>
                        1.4 A self-published comic with multiple chapters that has been serialized should have its own
                        separate entry. If the serialized comic uses the same title, the pre-serialized entry should
                        have "(Webcomic)" or the equivalent appended to the title. <br>
                        1.5 The previous rule aside, If there are multiple entries with the same title, do not add
                        anything to distinguish them. Use the actual title as it is. <br>
                        1.6 Do not add duplicate entries. Search for multiple alternate titles before adding a series.

                        preferable minimum resolution 300px * 450px but upload in the highest quality possible. <br>
                        1.7.2 Content: Use a cover image of a later volume, unless it either doesn't fit the overall art
                        style or theme of the comic or has major spoilers. <br>
                        1.7.3 Language: The main cover of a work should be in the same original language as the work
                        itself. Do not translate covers yourself and upload them.

                        1.8 Tag porn (and only porn) as hentai. Ecchi and smut do not count. The primary focus must be
                        on the sex, and genitals must be visible (typical censorship aside). <br>

                        2.2 MangaDex does not condone contacting groups about changing their restrictions or uploading
                        their releases. If you are contacting a group, be nice and make it clear you are not associated
                        with MangaDex. <br>
                        2.3 Abusing the chapter report function could result in a ban.
                        2.4 Do not report any releases for any translation or visual quality issues that originate from
                        the scanlator. These reports will be ignored.
                        2.5 Circumventing group upload restrictions in any way could result in a ban.<br>
                        2.6 Avoid edit wars. If another user edits a comic entry to something different from what you
                        had previously edited and you disagree with their edit, do not change it back, but immediately
                        notify a staff member. <br>
